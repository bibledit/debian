# Reasons for doing so are among others:
# - The Debian builder would otherwise notice differences
#   between the supplied tarball and the modified source.
#   dpkg-source: error: aborting due to unexpected upstream changes
# - In this way it does not need to generate patches in the 'debian' folder.
# - Comply with the Debian Free Software Guidelines.
